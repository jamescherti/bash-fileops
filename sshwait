# Description:
# ------------
# This script repeatedly attempts to check the availability of the SSH server on
# the host provided as the first argument. It exits with a 0 status upon
# successfully establishing a connection at least once. Note that it only
# verifies if the SSH server is reachable and does not provide a shell prompt or
# execute any commands on the remote host.
#
# Usage: ./script_name.sh <host>
